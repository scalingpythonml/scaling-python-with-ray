** Figs: Illustrations [ FILL IN: has posted the figs / is still working on the figs]. 
   19 total. (2 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.

   A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
