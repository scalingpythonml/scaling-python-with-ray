** Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.
** A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.

* Intake Report: atlas.oreilly.com/oreillymedia/scaling-python-with-ray/tools/intakereport.txt

* MS Snapshot: To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' by running the following command:

This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag was created. To switch the files back to the current state, run: 

$ git checkout main 

 Notes from Tools:
=================

* PROD: Add any authors to the project that need to be added.

* Syntax highlighting: applied to 148 out of 177 code listings.

* I changed two xrefs to match what seemed to be their intended ids. There are three more that I didn't see an obvious match for.
** Changed fault-tolerance -> fault_tolerance in ch05.asciidoc line 323
** Change more_awesome_wordcount --> more_awesome_wordcount_with_batches in ch09.asciidoc line 499
** ray_tls in ch12.asciidoc line 22
** app_deploying in ch05.asciidoc line 242
** appa_deploying ch05.asciidoc  line 455


* Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.
