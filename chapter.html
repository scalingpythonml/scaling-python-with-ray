<blockquote data-type="epigraph">
<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>

<p data-type="attribution">Lewis Carroll, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is a blockquote, and specifically it's an epigraph, with an attribution to the author. (Epigraphs are a subset of blockquotes.)</p>

<div data-type="note">
<h1>This Is a Note</h1>

<p>Many people use notes to qualify a statement they made in the preceding paragraphs, or to warn their readers about pitfalls they might run into.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, let's take a look at a figure with a caption:</p>

<figure><img alt="Drawing of tarsiers" src="images/tarsier.png" />
<figcaption>This is a caption describing the drawing of tarsiers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>This Is a B-Head</h2>

<p>Add your text here.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar">
<h5>Sidebar Title</h5>

<p>Here's a sidebar. Sidebars are great for setting aside a section of text that is related to the surrounding content but that doesn't necessarily fit into the main flow.</p>
